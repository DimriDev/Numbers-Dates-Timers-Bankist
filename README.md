This is a JS project

Purpose:
This part of the project aims to teach you how to effectively utilize JavaScript for managing numbers and dates within an application context, which is essential for providing a realistic banking experience.

Key Learning Areas:
Handling Numbers: Understanding how numbers work in JavaScript, including converting values to numbers and checking if certain values are indeed numbers. This involves learning about different number formats like floating-point representation.

Date Management: Implementing date features in transactions, such as recording and displaying the date of each transaction. You'll learn to store and manipulate date objects efficiently.

Internationalization: Displaying numbers and currencies according to user locale, which enhances user experience by making the application user-friendly across different regions.

Timers: Incorporating timers in the application can be used for features like delaying loan approvals, providing a more dynamic interaction for users.

Application in Bankist:
In the Bankist app, you will see the implementation of these concepts through:

A transactions array that includes date information alongside movements.
Currency formatting that adapts to different locales.
Functions that manage date and number handling integratively for a seamless user experience.
